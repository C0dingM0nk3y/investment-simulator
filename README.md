# investment-simulator

_version 1.0_: pre-release for testing. UI and UX will be improved on a later stage.

***

- **DCA simulator**: tool to calculate the historical yield for financial assets. Simulate a DCA investment plan starting from a certain date in the past and calculate how much would be the profit and losses of investing until today.
- **Rebalancing simulator**: [coming soon] 

### Why a webtool?

As a Data Scientist, I like to use real world data to build examples and to take more informed decision. With this tool, I hope to be able to inspire the new generation of investors to experiment different investment strategy _on historical data_ and grow confidence into this field, risking any of their capital.

_Are the benefits of long-term investing paying off its potential risks?_

## Project aim
I believe there is an increasing need for the new generation to be able to take care of their financial freedom, and take *now* good financial decision for *their future*.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of mistrust and suspicion around this subject and this discourages most people to ever begin their educational path toward financial. In my experience, this is often driven by 2 fears, both reasonable, but whose risk is highly overestimated.

- **fear of losing money** especially during the downtrend phases of market. 

- **fear not having enough time/experience** to take care of our finances successfully.

I wrote the DCA simulator to show that 
- **investing can be simple**. _There are investment strategies that only require **setting up a recurring transaction from our bank account** and, despite their easy implementation, can provide with significant capital gain, **especially after long time**_.

- **timing the market is mostly unnecessary**. _It may be relavant for trading, but it is largely uninfluencial for long-term investing._

- **there is no need to panic when the value of our assets goes down**. _Unless extremely lucky/skilled in timing the best moment to begin a new investment, **even the most profitable long-term investment go through phases during which their value decreases**. This is an expected component of financial cycles and should not cause panic. In fact, most gain will come from sticking to the investment plan **during those times**._


### Challenges and suggestion of use [to be completed]

- *Task 1: bad investments*
- *Task 2: the effect of time*
- *Task 3: psychology of investing*
