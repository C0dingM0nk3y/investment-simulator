# investment-simulator

version 0.1: pre-release for testing. New functions will be introduced later.

***

- **DCA simulator**: tool to calculate the historical yield for financial assets. Simulate a DCA investment plan starting from a certain date in the past and calculate how much would be the profit and losses of investing until today.
- **Rebalancing simulator**: [coming soon] 

## Project aim
I believe there is an increasing need for the new generation to be able to take care of their financial freedom, and take *now* good financial decision for *their future*.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of mistrust and suspicion around this subject and this discourages most people to ever begin their path toward financial education. This is often driven by one of the following 2 fears.

- **fear of losing money** especially during the downtrend phases of market. However, <span style="color:#84b0fa">downtrend phases of market are expected, and should not be feared, because *most of the future profits will come from keep investing during the harder times* </span>. _I tried to highlight that into the "Psychology of investing" section, part of the DCA simulator_.

- **fear not having enough time** (of not knowing enough), specifically to _follow the market and track price movements of their asset_. In contrast, <span style="color:#84b0fa"> great results can be achieved even by applying fully automated strategy that require *no maintenance* (beside occasional/yearly reviews)</span>. _The DCA simulator shows that it is possible to build solid strategy that leads to substantial profits and zero stress because, on the long run,the most important variable for each investment is_ **when it has started!**

*to receive help on chosing of the correct asset long-term assets, consult a finacial advisor. 

### Why a webtool?

As a Data Scientist, I like to use real world data to build examples and to take more informed decision. With this tool, I hope to be able to inspire the new generation of investors to experiemnt different investment strategy and test them out using simulation on historical data, rather than risking any of their capital.

_Are the benefits of long-term investing paying off its potential risks?_
